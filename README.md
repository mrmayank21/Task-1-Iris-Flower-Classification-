# oibsip_taskno.1
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them. 
In this code, i have taken the dataset directly through the link, just to make my code system independent.
You can also download the csv file from the link, but in that case you need to change some portion of code.
